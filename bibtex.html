  abstract = {One of the central themes in autonomous robot research concerns the question how visual images of body movements by others can be interpreted and related to one's own body movements and to language describing these body movements. The discovery of mirror neurons has shown that there are brain circuits which become active both in the perception and the re-enactment of bodily gestures, although it is so far unclear how these circuits can form, i.e. how neurons become mirror neurons. We report here further progress with our robot experiments in which a group of autonomous robots play language games in order to coordinate their visual, motor and cognitive body image. We have shown that the right kind of semiotic dynamics can lead to the self-organisation of a successful communication system with which robots can ask each other to perform certain actions. The main contribution of this paper is to show that if the robot has the capacity to `imagine' the behavior of his own body through self-simulation, he is better able to guess what action corresponds to a visual image produced by another robot and thus guess the meaning of an unknown word. This leads to a significant speed-up in the way individual agents are able to coordinate visual categories, motor behaviors and language.},<br>

  abstract = {Humans maintain a body image of themselves, which plays a central role in controlling bodily movement, planning action, recognising and naming actions performed by others, and requesting or executing commands. This paper explores through experiments with autonomous humanoid robots how such a body image could form. Robots play a situated embodied language game called the Action Game in which they ask each other to perform bodily actions. They start without any prior inventory of names, without categories for visually recognising body movements of others, and without knowing the relation between visual images of motor behaviors carried out by others and their own motor behaviors. Through diagnostic and repair strategies carried out within the context of action games, they progressively self-organise an effective lexicon as well as bi-directional mappings between the visual and the motor domain. The agents thus establish and continuously adapt networks linking perception, body representation, action, and language.},<br>

  abstract = {This paper presents a biologically inspired approach to posture recognition and posture change detection for a biped robot. Slow Feature Analysis, an algorithm developed by theoretical biologists for extracting slowly changing signals from signals varying on a fast time scale, is applied to the problem of recognizing the posture of biped humanoid robots over time and successively on the recognition of the change of posture. Both the recognition of basic static postures, like lying and standing, of peer robots via visual sensory information and the recognition of the same postures via internal proprioceptive sensors are considered. Given promising results in this domain we extend the application of the method onto the dynamic domain of detecting the change of posture, specifically we show the utility of the algorithm for detecting when a robot falls.},<br>

  abstract = {Open-ended language communication remains an enormous challenge for autonomous robots. This paper argues that the notion of a language strategy is the appropriate vehicle for addressing this challenge. A language strategy packages all the procedures that are necessary for playing a language game. We present a specific example of a language strategy for playing an Action Game in which one robot asks another robot to take on a body posture (such as stand or sit), and show how it effectively allows a population of agents to self-organise a perceptually grounded ontology and a lexicon from scratch, without any human intervention. Next, we show how a new language strategy can arise by exaptation from an existing one, concretely, how the body posture strategy can be exapted to a strategy for playing language games about the spatial position of objects (as in ``the bottle stands on the table'').},<br>

  abstract = {Colour naming games are idealised communicative interactions within a population of artificial agents in which a speaker uses a single colour term to draw the attention of a hearer to a particular object in a shared context. Through a series of such games, a colour lexicon can be developed that is sufficiently shared to allow for successful communication, even when the agents start out without any predefined categories. In previous models of colour naming games, the shared context was typically artificially generated from a set of colour stimuli and both agents in the interaction perceive this environment in an identical way. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the colour naming game in a robotic setup in which humanoid robots perceive a set of colourful objects from their own perspective. We compare the resulting colour ontologies to those found in human languages and show how these ontologies reflect the environment in which they were developed.},<br>

For this, we endow the agents with cognitive mechanisms and structures that are instantiations of specific ideas in cognitive linguistics (namely image schema theory) about how humans relate motor and visual space. We show that the agents are indeed able to perform well in the task and thus the experiment offers a concrete operationalization of these theories and increases their explanatory power.},<br>

  abstract = {Artificial agents trying to achieve communicative goals in situated interactions in the real-world need powerful computational systems for conceptualizing their environment. In order to provide embodied artificial systems with rich semantics reminiscent of human language complexity, agents need ways of both conceptualizing complex compositional semantic structure and actively reconstructing semantic structure, due to uncertainty and ambiguity in transmission. Furthermore, the systems must be open-ended and adaptive and allow agents to adjust their semantic inventories in order to reach their goals. This paper presents recent progress in modeling open-ended, grounded semantics through a unified software system that addresses these problems.},<br>

  abstract = {How can we explain the enormous amount of creativity and flexibility in spatial language use? In this paper we detail computational experiments that try to capture the essence of this puzzle. We hypothesize that flexible semantics which allow agents to conceptualize reality in many different ways are key to this issue. We will introduce our particular semantic modeling approach as well as the coupling of conceptual structures to the language system. We will justify the approach and show how these systems play together in the evolution of spatial language using humanoid robots.},<br>

  abstract = {All languages of the world have a way to talk about space and spatial relations of objects. Cross-culturally, immense variation in how people conceptualize space for language has been attested. Different spatial conceptualization strategies such as proximal, projective and absolute have been identified to underlie peoples conception of spatial reality. This paper argues that spatial conceptualization strategies are negotiated in a cultural process of linguistic selection. Conceptualization strategies originate in the cognitive capabilities of agents. The ecological conditions and the structure of the environment influence the conceptualization strategy agents invent and which corresponding system of lexicon and ontology of spatial relations is selected for. The validity of these claims is explored using populations of humanoid robots.},<br>

In order, for robots to be able to interpret and produce utterances about the real world, they have to link symbolic information to continuous perceptual spaces. This requires dealing with inherent vagueness, noise and differences in perspective in the perception of the real world.

It reports on preliminary experiments whereby speakers introduce hierarchical constructions and grammatical markers to express which conceptualization strategy hearers are supposed to invoke. This grammatical information helps hearers to avoid semantic ambiguity or errors in interpretation. A simulation study is performed for spatial grammar using robotic agents that play language games about objects in their shared world. The chapter uses a reconstruction of a fragment of German spatial language to identify the niche of spatial grammar, and then reports on acquisition and formation experiments in which agents seeded with a `pidgin German' without grammar are made to interact until rudiments of hierarchical structure and grammatical marking emerge.},<br>

The agents play a Posture Game in which the speaker asks the hearer to take on a certain posture.

	Abstract = {This paper reports recent progress on modeling the grounded co-acquisition of syntax and semantics of locative spatial language in developmental robots. We show how a learner robot can learn to produce and interpret spatial utterances in guided-learning interactions with a tutor robot (equipped with a sys- tem for producing English spatial phrases). The tutor guides the learning process by simplifying the challenges and complexity of utterances, gives feedback, and gradually increases the complexity of the language to be learnt. Our experiments show promising results towards long-term, incremental acquisition of natural language in a process of co- development of syntax and semantics.},<br>

        Abstract = {This paper discusses the application of a procedural semantics framework to autonomous robots. We model insights from decades of research in cognitive linguistics and empirical research to develop a system capable of autonomously producing and interpreting German locative utterances. The system is tested in the real world using a population of robots that talk to each other via natural language.},<br>

	Abstract = {The question of how symbol systems can be instantiated in neural network-like computation is still open. Many technical challenges remain and most proposals do not scale up to realistic examples of symbol processing, for example, language understanding or language production. Here we use a top-down approach. We start from Fluid Construction Grammar, a well-worked out framework for language processing that is compatible with recent insights into Construction Grammar and investigate how we could build a neural compiler that automatically translates grammatical constructions and grammatical processing into neural computations. We proceed in two steps. FCG is translated from symbolic processing to numeric processing using a vector symbolic architecture, and this numeric processing is then translated into neural network computation. Our experiments are still in an early stage but already show promise.},<br>
